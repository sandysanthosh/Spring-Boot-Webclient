Here's an example of how to configure a WebClient to make requests to the External API in a Spring Boot application using WebClient


```

@Configuration
public class ExternalWebClientConfiguration {

    private final String externalBaseUrl;

    public ExternalWebClientConfiguration(@Value("${External.base-url}") String externalBaseUrl) {
        this.externalBaseUrl = externalBaseUrl;
    }

    @Bean
    public WebClient externalBaseUrlWebClient() {
        return WebClient.builder()
                .baseUrl(externalBaseUrl)
                .defaultHeader(HttpHeaders.CONTENT_TYPE, MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE)
                .defaultHeader(HttpHeaders.ACCEPT, MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE)
                .build();
    }
}


```



This configuration class sets up a WebClient bean named externalWebClient. The @Value annotation is used to inject the external.base-url property from the application properties file.

The WebClient is built using the WebClient.builder() method. The baseUrl method sets the base URL for all requests made with this WebClient. The defaultHeader method sets the Content-Type and Accept headers to application/json.

Once you have configured the WebClient, you can use it to make requests to the external API. Here's an example of how to use the externalWebClient bean to make a request to the external API:

  
```

@Service
public class MyService {

    private final WebClient externalWebClient;

    public MyService(WebClient externalWebClient) {
        this.externalWebClient = externalWebClient;
    }

    public Mono<MyResponse> makeExternalRequest() {
        return externalWebClient.get()
                .uri("/my-endpoint")
                .retrieve()
                .bodyToMono(MyResponse.class);
    }
}

```

This code injects the ExternalWebClient bean into a service class named MyService. The makeExternalRequest method uses the WebClient to make a GET request to the /my-endpoint endpoint of the External API. The response is converted to a Mono<MyResponse> using the bodyToMono method.

Note that this is just an example, and you'll need to adjust it to fit your specific use case. Also, you'll need to make sure that the WebClient dependencies are included in your project's build file, such as build.gradle or pom.xml.
