Here's an example of how to configure a WebClient to make requests to the Fixact API in a Spring Boot application using WebClient


```

@Configuration
public class FixactWebClientConfiguration {

    private final String fixactBaseUrl;

    public FixactWebClientConfiguration(@Value("${fixact.base-url}") String fixactBaseUrl) {
        this.fixactBaseUrl = fixactBaseUrl;
    }

    @Bean
    public WebClient fixactWebClient() {
        return WebClient.builder()
                .baseUrl(fixactBaseUrl)
                .defaultHeader(HttpHeaders.CONTENT_TYPE, MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE)
                .defaultHeader(HttpHeaders.ACCEPT, MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE)
                .build();
    }
}


```



This configuration class sets up a WebClient bean named fixactWebClient. The @Value annotation is used to inject the fixact.base-url property from the application properties file.

The WebClient is built using the WebClient.builder() method. The baseUrl method sets the base URL for all requests made with this WebClient. The defaultHeader method sets the Content-Type and Accept headers to application/json.

Once you have configured the WebClient, you can use it to make requests to the Fixact API. Here's an example of how to use the fixactWebClient bean to make a request to the Fixact API:

  
```

@Service
public class MyService {

    private final WebClient fixactWebClient;

    public MyService(WebClient fixactWebClient) {
        this.fixactWebClient = fixactWebClient;
    }

    public Mono<MyResponse> makeFixactRequest() {
        return fixactWebClient.get()
                .uri("/my-endpoint")
                .retrieve()
                .bodyToMono(MyResponse.class);
    }
}

```

This code injects the fixactWebClient bean into a service class named MyService. The makeFixactRequest method uses the WebClient to make a GET request to the /my-endpoint endpoint of the Fixact API. The response is converted to a Mono<MyResponse> using the bodyToMono method.

Note that this is just an example, and you'll need to adjust it to fit your specific use case. Also, you'll need to make sure that the WebClient dependencies are included in your project's build file, such as build.gradle or pom.xml.
